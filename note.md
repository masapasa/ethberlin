rollups - specialized - general purpose, arbitrary smart contracts requires zkvm
zkrollups for payments, proof of computing by compression, repeats the computing. i send you a small proof of computing and you accept the proof of computing. Network of operators offers similar capabilities to ethereum. zkprover does the magic work and the zkproof is written in the erc smart contracts format. The initial state of the blockchain is taken from the initial computing and the final state of the blockchain is sent to the smart contracts. This allows for higher throughput, lower fee rate, and the security of the blockchain is not compromised. At Eth paris people claimed that the zk ws not evm compatible. 1. fully compatible with ethereum, 2. fully compatible with evm, 2.5 modify evm only by gas, 3. somehow compatible with evm, 4. fully compatible with solidity
evm equivalence with 85% and passes test vectors. Complete and fast zk proof of computing with zkevm completely implemented. All Opcodes supported except some precompiled. High scalability, zk proofs recursion implemented. 2m gas units proof in 10 min in a single 64 core server. Can run in less energy than required for a room. recursion allows for proof of proof. Proving a lot of changes in state.
Decentralization is considered from the inception with a lot of experience gained from hermez networks. Proofs can be computed in parallel.
